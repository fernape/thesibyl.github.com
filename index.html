<h3>The problem: keeping shadow files secure</h3>
<p>Secure storage of the <code>shadow</code> file and, in
general, of any database of secret authentication tokens
(think of passwords of users of a Web-based service) is one of
the main security concerns of a Systems Administrator.</p>
<p>With the advent of rainbow tables and cheap fast hardware,
this problem has become especially relevant: today, dictionary
attacks take negligible time (and the fact is
that <strong>users</strong> will end up using passwords as
simple as possible).</p>
<p>We present a different approach for storing shadow files:
using a separate server for checking the correctness of the
password introduced by the user, taking advantage of asymmetric
key encryption.</p>
<p>In summary: instead of keeping the hash
(as <code>crypt(3)</code> does, or <code>SHA1</code>) of the
password in the <code>shadow</code> file, store an OAEP
RSA-cyphertext of the password (using a public encryption key)
and, each time the user tries to log in, ask <i>someone</i> (the
owner of the <i>private</i> key) if the OAEP-encryption of the
password issued by the logging user matches the stored
cyphertext. That is: use an oracle to ask if the user has
entered the correct password or not. This oracle is <strong>the
Sibyl</strong>.</p>
